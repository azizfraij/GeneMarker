# Contributing to GeneMarker

We're thrilled you're considering contributing to GeneMarker! This document outlines the process for contributing to the project and how you can help make GeneMarker even better.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Begin by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This is your workspace for making changes.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**
   - Clone your fork to your local machine to start working on the changes.

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Ensure you have the necessary development environment set up, including any specific software, libraries, or tools required for GeneMarker.

## Making Changes

1. **Create a New Branch**
   - For each new feature, improvement, or bug fix, create a new branch in your forked repository. Name your branches clearly, e.g., `feature/your-feature-name`, `bugfix/description-of-the-bug`.

2. **Develop and Test Your Changes**
   - Make your changes in your branch. Be sure to test your changes thoroughly to ensure they meet the project's quality standards and do not introduce new issues.

3. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Commit your changes with a clear commit message that explains the "what" and "why" of your work (not how). For example: "Add gene pattern recognition feature for improved mutation analysis".

4. **Keep Your Branch Updated**
   - Regularly merge changes from the main branch of the original GeneMarker repository into your branch to stay up-to-date and minimize merge conflicts.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push Your Changes**
   - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Navigate to the original GeneMarker repository you forked. Click on "Pull Requests" and then the "New Pull Request" button. Choose your branch and review the changes.

3. **Describe Your Pull Request**
   - Provide a clear, detailed description of your pull request. Include the purpose of the changes, any issues it addresses, and any relevant information for reviewers.

4. **Submit Your Pull Request**
   - Once you're satisfied with your description and the changes, submit your pull request.

## Review Process

After submission, your pull request will be reviewed by the project maintainers. This process helps ensure that the project remains high quality and cohesive. You may receive feedback or requests for changes to your contribution. This is a normal part of the review process, so don't be discouraged!

## Coding Guidelines

When contributing to GeneMarker, please adhere to the following coding guidelines to maintain a high standard of code quality and ensure consistency across the project.

#### General

#### Python

- Follow the [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide for Python code.
- Use descriptive names for functions and variables.
- Document your code with comments and docstrings. Follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for docstrings.

- Place each component in its own file.
- Use functional components with hooks.
- Document component props with PropTypes.

#### Git Commit Messages

- Start the commit message with a capital letter.
- Use the imperative mood in the commit message, e.g., "Fix bug in data processing", not "Fixed" or "Fixes".
- Keep the first line of the commit message under 50 characters. If more detail is necessary, add a blank line and then a more detailed description.

#### Pull Requests

- Provide a concise and descriptive title for your pull request.
- In the description, clearly explain the changes you've made and the problem it solves.
- Link any related issues in your pull request description.

### Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Run the existing test suite to ensure your changes haven't introduced any regressions.
- Aim for a high level of test coverage.

### Security

- Be mindful of security issues. Don't introduce vulnerabilities or sensitive data into the codebase.
- Follow best practices for the security of the code you contribute.
