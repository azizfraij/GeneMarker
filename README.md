# GeneMarker
GeneMarker is at the forefront of revolutionizing genetic data analysis through AI-powered technology. Designed to sift through millions of lines of human genetic data, our platform identifies patterns related to diseases and mutations, facilitating early diagnosis of medical issues. By uncovering new patterns and gene connections, GeneMarker not only aids in predictive health care but also opens doors to groundbreaking discoveries in genetics.

## Key Features
* **Gene Mapping:** Utilizes advanced algorithms for mapping genes related to specific health conditions and traits, offering insights into genetic influences on human health.
* **Disease & Mutations Analysis:** Pinpoints genetic markers associated with diseases and mutations, enabling early diagnosis and personalized medicine approaches.
* **Big Data Analysis & Modeling:** Employs robust big data techniques to analyze vast amounts of genetic information, extracting meaningful patterns and trends.
* **Large Pattern Recognition Modeling:** Leverages state-of-the-art pattern recognition models to identify complex genetic correlations, pushing the boundaries of current genetic research.

## Goals and Stretch Goals

### Primary Goals
* Develop a scalable AI framework capable of efficiently processing and analyzing millions of genetic data points.
* Implement a highly accurate gene mapping algorithm to detect associations between genetic markers and diseases.
* Provide actionable insights for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare strategies based on genetic predispositions.

### Stretch Goals
